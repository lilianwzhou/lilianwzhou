 ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Lilian! I'm currently a senior at UC Berkeley pursuing a degree in Data Science with a minor in Education. 

In my past lives, I was: 

- a SWE Research Intern @ [SLAC](https://www6.slac.stanford.edu/)
- DS Team Lead @ [CarpeMed](https://www.carpemedtravel.com/) 

I'm currently recruiting for 2022 new grad opportunities. I'd love to get in touch! Shoot me an email at lilianwzhou@berkeley.edu.
